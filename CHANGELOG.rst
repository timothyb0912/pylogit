  based on linear-algebra decompositions. (#30)
- Added journal reference for the accompanying paper in the project README.
  (#35)
- Added project logo to the repository. (#46)
- Switched to pip-tools for specifying development dependencies. (#58)
- Added Makefile to standardize development installation. (#59)
- Switched to flit for packaging. (#60)
- Added towncrier to repository. (#61)
- Added tox to the repository for cross-version testing of PyLogit. (#63)
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for Continuous Integration. (#64)
- Converted the README.rst file to README.md. (#65)
- Adding bump2version to development requirements. (#66)


Pylogit 0.2.2 (2017-12-11)

Pylogit 0.2.0 (2017-12-10)
==========================

Added new features
------------------

- Added support for Python 3.4 - 3.6
- Added AIC and BIC to summary tables of all models.
- Added support for bootstrapping and calculation of bootstrap confidence intervals:

  - percentile intervals,
  - bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and
  - approximate bootstrap confidence (ABC) intervals.

- Changed sparse matrix creation to enable estimation of larger datasets.


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Refactored internal code organization and classes for estimation.


Pylogit 0.1.2 (2016-12-04)
==========================

Added new features
------------------

- Added support to all logit-type models for parameter constraints during model estimation.
  All models now support the use of the constrained_pos keyword argument.
- Added new argument checks to provide user-friendly error messages.
- Created more than 175 tests, bringing statement coverage to 99%.
- Updated the underflow and overflow protections to make use of L’Hopital’s rule where appropriate.


Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed bugs with the nested logit model.
  In particular, the predict function, the BHHH approximation to the Fisher Information Matrix, and the ridge regression penalty in the log-likelihood, gradient, and hessian functions have been fixed.


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Added new example notebooks demonstrating prediction, mixed logit, and converting long-format datasets to wide-format.
- Edited docstrings for clarity throughout the library.


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Extensively refactored codebase.

- Added new datasets to the github repo.


Pylogit 0.1.0 (2016-08-29)
==========================

Added new features
------------------

Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

 - Made print statements compatible with python3.
 - Fixed typos in library documentation.
 - Internal refactoring.


Pylogit 0.0.0 (2016-03-15)
