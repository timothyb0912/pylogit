This project has been assisted by numerous individuals and organizations.

Dr. Akshay Vij contributed code that was the basis for the conditional logit
code, and he provided the motivation and guidance behind the use of "mapping
matrices" that is standard throughout PyLogit.

Professor John Canny advised Vij on optimizing the code used for the
conditional logit, and as such he also helped the development of this package.

Professor Paul Waddell has graciously provided the financial support that
helped ensure continued progress on this package.

Oleksandr Lysenko ported PyLogit to Python >= 3.4.

Eunice Poon designed the logo.
