What PyLogit is
===============
PyLogit is a Python package for performing maximum likelihood estimation of conditional logit models and similar discrete choice models.

Main Features
=============

* Conditional Logit (Type) Models

   - Multinomial Logit Models
   - Multinomial Asymmetric Models

      + Multinomial Clog-log Model
      + Multinomial Scobit Model
      + Multinomial Uneven Logit Model
      + Multinomial Asymmetric Logit Model
   - Nested Logit Models
   - Mixed Logit Models (with Normal mixing distributions)

* Supports datasets where the choice set differs across observations
* Supports model specifications where the coefficient for a given variable may be

   - completely alternative-specific (i.e. one coefficient per alternative, subject to identification of the coefficients),
   - subset-specific (i.e. one coefficient per subset of alternatives, where each alternative belongs to only one subset, and there are more than 1 but less than J subsets, where J is the maximum number of available alternatives in the dataset),
   - completely generic (i.e. one coefficient across all alternatives).

Where to get it
===============
Available from PyPi::
    pip install pylogit

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylogit

Available through Anaconda::
    conda install -c timothyb0912 pylogit
